To compile the files just execute the command make as showed below:
    $ make

The command make will compile the .c files and it will generate the 
executable ones.

Once you have the executable files, in one terminal you execute the
server with the command:
    $ ./server

Open a new tab on terminal and execute one of the clients executable
files (client or clientOpenMp):
    $ ./client
    or
    $ ./clientOpenMp

After that, check the server output and you will see how long it took
for the client application to run.

Feel free to play around and modify the code as you need.
